# Hello. 
## My name is Casey. I'm a front end developer who loves to solve problems. 

### React / Redux / JavaScript / HTML / CSS

:dollar: My most recent project was the [Donor Management Portal](https://github.com/CaseyPitman/Donor-Management-Portal), a React web app with CRUD operations that allows non-profit and charitable organizations to maintain donor records.  
  
:rocket: I am currently working on my [next project](https://github.com/CaseyPitman/nasa-apod) - an interface with the [NASA OPEN APIs](https://api.nasa.gov/) APOD and Image Library. 
 
:books: I am currently learning [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).
