# Hello. 
### My name is Casey. 
### I am a front end developer who loves to solve problems. 

#### React / Redux / JavaScript / HTML / CSS

:dollar: My most recent project was the [Donor Management Portal](https://github.com/CaseyPitman/Donor-Management-Portal), a tool React web app with CRUD operations that allows non-profit and charitable organizations to maintain records of past donors, including contact information and donation histories.  
  
:bell: I am currently planning my next project. It will be a schedule building app that allows users in the education field to input certain criteria (school day start and end times, number of classes, duration between classes, lunch lengths and times, etc.) and automatically generate a bell schedule with minimal effort required from the user.  
 
:books: I am currently learning [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). I've been looking forward to learning Node for a while, and I'm excited to start exploring the back end side of things.
